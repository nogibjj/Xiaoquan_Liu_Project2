## Building a Command-Line Tool in Bash

Welcome! This is my second project for the Data Engineering System class at Duke. 

For this project, I tried to build two Bash Command-Line tools. One was written in shell script, and the other one was written in Python script.

### 1. Food Choices CLI Written in Shell Script

  Following this formula, I made a simple command-line tool in bash.
  
  if you call    **./food_choices.sh --choose "Yogurt"** from bash, it will return   **(a random emoji)Eat Yogurt with Frozen Fruits!**
 
### 2. Word Frequency CLI Written in Python Script
